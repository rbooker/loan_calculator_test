# loan_calculator_test
An app for calculating the monthly payments for a loan, given its principal (or "principle" as the semi-literate dunces who write the materials for the coding bootcamp I'm attending refer to it), length, and rate of interest. It's not terribly fleshed out (there's no error handling, for instance) as its primary purpose is to be used for Jasmine unit testing.
